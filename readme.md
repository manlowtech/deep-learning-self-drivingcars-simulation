## SELF DRIVING CAR SIMULATION DEEP COMPUTER VISION
In this paert i am detecting lanes on a given road video.
While driving the car in the video simulation,the task is to detect lanes and show the with green line demacations.
I am experimenting with different algorithms to find out the best algorithm for self driving cars.
## note
I didnt upload the video because the file but is too large, anyone using this code you can upload your own video with the test4.mp4 as name
